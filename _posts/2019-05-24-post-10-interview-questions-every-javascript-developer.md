At most companies, management must trust the developers to give technical interviews in order to assess candidate skills. If you do well as a candidate, you'll eventually need to interview. Here's how.

### It Starts With People

In ["How to Build a High Velocity Development Team"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-build-a-high-velocity-development-team-4b2360d34021), I made a couple points worh repeating:

> *"Nothing predicts business outcomes better than an exceptional team. If your're going to beat the odds, you need to invest here, first."*

As Marcus Lemonis says, focus on the 3 P's:

### *"People, Process, Product"*

Your early hires should be very strong, senior-level candidates. People who can hire and mentor other developers, and help the mid-level and junior developers you'll eventually want to hire down the road.

Read ["Why Hiring is So Hard in Tech"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-hiring-is-so-hard-in-tech-c462c3230017) for a good breakdown of the general do's and don'ts of candidate evaluation.

### *The best way to evaluate a candidate is a pair programming exercise.*

---

Pair program with the candidate. Let the candidate drive. Watch and listen more than you talk. A good project might be to pull tweets from the Twitter API and display them on a timeline.

That said. no single exercise will tell you everything you need to know. An interview can be a very useful tool as well, but don't waste time asking about syntax or language quirks. You need to see the big picture. Ask about architecture and paradigms -- the big decisions that can have major impact on the whole project.

Syntax and features are easy to Google. It's much harder to Google for software engineering wisdom or the common paradigms and idioms JavaScript developers pick up with experience.

JavaScript is special, and it plays a critical role in almost every large application. What is it about JavaScript that makes it meaningfully different from other languages?

Hear are some questions that will help you explore the stuff that really matters:

### **1. Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?**

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting **imperative/procedural** programming along with **OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) and **functional programming**. JavaScript supports OOP with **prototypal inheritance**.

#### Good to hear:

* Prototypal Inheritance (alsl: prototypes, OLOO).

* Functional programming (also: closures, first class functions, lambdas).

#### Red flags:

* No clue what a paradigm is, no mention of prototypal oo or functional programming.
